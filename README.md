How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns to input the row and column where they want to place their mark (X or O).
Rows and columns are numbered 0, 1, and 2.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If the entire grid is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Features
Simple and intuitive console interface.
Two-player mode for human players.
Basic input validation to ensure valid moves.
Automatic detection of win or draw conditions.
Modular design with separate classes for game logic and user interface.
Future Improvements

Implementing a computer player using various AI algorithms.
Adding color or ASCII art to make the interface more visually appealing.
Allowing players to choose their marks (symbols).
Adding more advanced input handling for better user experience.
